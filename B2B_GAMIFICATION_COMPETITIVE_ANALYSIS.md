# B2B GAMIFICATION COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS
**Deep Research: What exists vs. Premium Gastro's superior approach**

---

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**KEY FINDING**: Current B2B gamification platforms focus on generic points/badges systems rather than psychological tier manipulation combined with zero-cost value creation.

**PREMIUM GASTRO'S ADVANTAGE**: We combine advanced psychology (status > discounts) with proprietary SaaS value creation that costs us nothing but feels premium to customers.

**MARKET GAP**: No competitor offers Czech-specific psychology combined with equipment supplier-specific tier benefits.
