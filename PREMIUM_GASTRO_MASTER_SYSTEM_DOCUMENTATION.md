## 🧠 CORE PSYCHOLOGICAL FOUNDATION

### **Primary Psychological Principles**:
1. **Fear > Reward**: Amygdala responds 3x stronger to negative stimuli
2. **Status > Money**: Top restaurants prefer recognition over discounts  
3. **Choice Illusion**: 2-3 options makes customers feel they chose freely
4. **Hidden Manipulation**: Most effective when customer doesn't know it exists
5. **Effort Justification**: Customers value rewards they work for more highly
6. **16 Motivators**: Each customer has unique psychological drivers that can be identified and leveraged

### **Czech Restaurant Industry Psychology**:
- **Ego-driven decision makers**: Restaurant owners have large egos tied to their business success
- **Community competition**: Everyone knows everyone, reputation matters immensely  
- **Status signaling**: Equipment choices signal restaurant positioning to peers
- **Local market dynamics**: Prague vs. regional differences in competitive behavior
- **16-year relationship building**: Long-term trust more valuable than short-term profit
